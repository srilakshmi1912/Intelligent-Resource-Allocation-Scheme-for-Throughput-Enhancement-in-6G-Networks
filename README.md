# Intelligent-Resource-Allocation-Scheme-for-Throughput-Enhancement-in-6G-Networks
This research proposes a DRL-powered intelligent resource allocation scheme for 6G networks in smart hospitals, optimizing bandwidth and computing power to meet diverse QoS needs. Comparing DDPG and DQN algorithms, it evaluates learning capacity, throughput, and edge capability to enhance hospital efficiency.
